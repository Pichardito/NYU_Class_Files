<h2>Who We Are</h2>

<p>
Founded in 2013 with a mission of improving access to healthcare, TestSmart is a free service that allows patients to find a nearby diagnostic center who accepts their insurance, see their real-time availability, and instantly book an appointment via testSmart.com. By revealing the 'hidden supply' of appointments, TestSmart helps most patients get access to testing facilities in just 24 to 72 hours. The company's most recent product, TestSmart Check-In, allows patients to fill out their paperwork online in advance of their appointment, and a Spanish-language version called TestSmart en Español is also available. More than 2.5 million people use TestSmart each month across 1,700+ cities, covering 40 percent of the US population.

Besides being a great service for both patients and testing facilities, TestSmart is also a great place to work! We’re honored to have been named one of the Best Places to Work in New York City by Crain’s New York for three years in a row, one of Modern Healthcare’s Best Places to Work in Healthcare for two consecutive years, and one of Fortune Magazine’s 50 Best Small and Medium Workplaces.
