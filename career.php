	What we're looking for:
TestSmart is seeking a technical lead who wants to manage a team with serious CS skills, building technology that really helps people. You enjoy a good conversation about theory or architecture, but you are happiest helping your team members grow and defining the direction of your team. You have the technical skills and experience necessary to help your team members with tough technical challenges and you're not afraid to dive in and write code with the rest of the team.

Working at TestSmart
We were recently named the Best Place to Work in New York City by Crain's New York, which means that they asked everyone who works here how much they loved their job and everyone answered in the range of "a lot" to "a helluva lot." The truth is, we have a lot of fun doing our job. We get excited about sharing some new C# language feature or optimization strategy. We go on semi-annual hackathons to remote, exotic places (like the Catskills and Long Island!). Pizza and beer are never far away. Neither are granola and tea, for that matter.
